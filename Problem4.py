Elijah Morgan Problem 4- Largest Palindrome Product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Originally I looked into a solution utilizing the patterns described in sequence A002113 on oeis.org...
# ...but, decided to just go with brute force for now. I'll return to this question again.

# The list of number is done in reverse order to save time, as I only need the LARGEST palindrome product.
